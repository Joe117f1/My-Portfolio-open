This is a [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About this project

This portfolio website uses many core features of React and NEXT.js, and styled by CSS modules. Some of the features are React hooks (useState, UseEffect, and useRef), React-Portal, NEXT.js useRouter hook, and various NEXT components. the Contact-form is built with the third-party package: React-Form-Hook, which I find quite awesome..! and I integrated it with SendGrid by twilio.

All the projects data in this website is fetched from MongoDB and prerendered by NEXT.js SSG feature.
